Local Government Area Summary
This data shows the total average scores for maths and reading. Although the mean scores were lower the percentage of students passing was higher.

School Summary
The data shows the average scores as per the school and school type. This data shows that the overall pass rate for Independent schools were higher despite their allocation of budget per student being lower in most of the scenarios. The capacity of students in independent schools was also lower compared to government schools.

Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
This data shows the 5 top performing schools and through the data we can conclude that 3 out of 5 schools that are top performing are independent schools with the budget per student lower than the government schools.

Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
This data shows the 5 bottom performing schools and through the data we can conclude that 4 out of 5 schools that are bottom performing are government schools with the budget per student higher than the independent schools.

Maths Scores by Year
The average maths score has been considerably even across the schools and years as well. Holden High School average did improve from year 9 to year 12 with highest improvement in year 10.

Reading Scores by Year
The average reading score has been considerably even across the schools and years as well. Bailey High School average did improve in year 12.

Scores by School Spending
The highest % overall passing shows for the spending range of $585-630 per student.

Scores by School Size
The highest % overall passing shows for the school size which is "small(<1000)".

Scores by School Type
The highest % overall passing shows for the independent school type.

The conclusion is that Independent Schools have smaller groups of students and the data shows the budget is adequate per student hence the average pass rates and overall pass rates are higher for Independent Schools.
The other conclusion is that the Government Schools are operating above capacity and that affects the overall passing rates. It is encouraged to get reports from the top performing government schools to ensure standardisation across the education industry and also to streamline processes so that the performance of other government schools may improve.
